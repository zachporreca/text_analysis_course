# text_analysis_course


Hey guys, it was fun getting to show you around the text analysis stuff. 

The data file I was using is a bit too large to store here on github, so instead here is a link to it on Google Drive

To replicate what we went over today you will need to do the following:
   1) Download the main data file from the google drive link
   2) Download intro.txt and tutorial.r from the github folder
   3) Installl the following packages for R:
        1) readtext
        2) quanteda
        3) quanteda.textplots
        4) ggplot2

Packages for R can be installed as follows:
    1) In RStudio's top menu choose "Tools"
    2) Select "Install Packages" from the drop down menu
    3) Enter the names of the packages you'd like to install (seperating each by a comma)
    4) Ensure that the "Install dependencies" box is checked
    5) Click install
